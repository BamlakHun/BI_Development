# Revenue BI Dashboard Development
Summary:
The goal of this project is to design and develop a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard that provides insights into monthly revenue, order counts, top-selling products, and other key metrics. The dashboard will be built using SQL queries for data retrieval and Looker Studio for visualizations, with a focus on interactivity, data quality, and effective presentation.

Steps Involved:
1. Data Retrieval with SQL

Extract the necessary data from the database to power the dashboard using SQL queries.

Step 1: Understand Data Requirements
Review the business needs and determine which metrics are most important for the dashboard (e.g., monthly revenue, order count by country, daily revenue, etc.).
Step 2: Write SQL Queries
Develop SQL queries to retrieve the following key data:
Monthly revenue and order count by country.
Daily revenue and top-selling products.
Heatmap data (e.g., for geographic or time-based trends).
Example SQL queries:
MS SQL Server

    SELECT 
      country, 
      SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue, 
      COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY country;

Step 3: Export Results as CSV Files
Export the data into CSV format for easy import into Looker Studio.

2. Import Data into Looker Studio

Upload the CSV files into Looker Studio and configure the data for visualization.
Step 1: Connect Looker Studio to Data
Upload the exported CSV files to Looker Studio as data sources.
Step 2: Configure Data Fields
Ensure all necessary fields are properly configured and mapped in Looker Studio (e.g., date fields, revenue, product names).

3. Build Visualizations in Looker Studio

Create visualizations that answer specific business questions and provide actionable insights.
Step 1: Design the Dashboard Layout
Plan the dashboard structure (e.g., overview section, detailed metrics, and visual breakdowns by product or region).
Step 2: Create Key Visualizations
Build charts and graphs that highlight key insights:
Bar charts for top-selling products and revenue comparison.
Time series graphs for daily and monthly revenue trends.
Heatmaps to visualize regional revenue or sales performance.
Step 3: Ensure Data Accuracy
Validate the visualizations against the raw data to ensure accuracy.

4. Customize and Publish the Dashboard
Objective:
Enhance the dashboard with additional features and share it with stakeholders.
Step 1: Customize the Dashboard
Add interactivity (e.g., filters for product categories, time periods, regions).
Implement custom branding (e.g., logo, company colors).
Step 2: Publish and Share the Dashboard
Publish the final dashboard to Looker Studio.
Share the dashboard with relevant stakeholders for feedback and decision-making.
Step 3: Monitor and Update
Regularly update the dashboard with new data as needed and ensure it remains aligned with business goals.

Tools Used:
MS SQL server: Data extraction and transformation.
Looker Studio: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
CSV: Data export and import.

Expected Outcome:
The final dashboard will provide a comprehensive, interactive view of key revenue metrics, helping stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. Visualizations will be tailored to answer specific business questions and provide insights into employee performance, sales trends, and customer behaviors.

Summary of Key Features:
Revenue Tracking: Monthly revenue and order count by country.
Sales Insights: Daily revenue trends and top-selling products.
Geographic Insights: Heatmaps for geographic revenue trends.
Interactive Filters: Custom filters to explore data by time period, product, or region.
Custom Branding: Dashboard styled according to company branding.
